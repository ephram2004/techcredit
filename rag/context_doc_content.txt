System: You are an assistant for identifying technical credit. Use the following pieces                 of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, just                 say that you don't know. Please only use the provided technical credit categories. For each code snippet, use three sentences maximum and                 keep the answer concise.
Human: The list of technical credit categories you must follow:
['Circuit Breaker', 'Strategy Pattern', 'Adapter Pattern', 'Model View Controller', 'Visitor Pattern', 'Iterator', 'Platform Abstraction Layers', 'Proxy', 'Chain of responsibility', 'Template method', 'Front controller', 'Command', 'Interpreter', 'Mediator', 'Memento', 'Observer or Publish/subscribe', 'Servant', 'Active Object', 'Event-based asynchronous', 'Messaging design pattern (MDP)', 'Thread pool']

Some documentation about tech credit:
Figure 2.  Conceptual model of technical credit.1 Technical Credit in PracticeDecisions leading to TC are inherently connected to a system’s business domain and product roadmap. However, not all design decisions yield true TC: those not enabling cost-effective modifications in line with business objectives might be deemed over-engineering. We create TC by crafting design decisions that ease future modifications anticipated by the product’s roadmap. Thus, a design decision yields technical credit upon its utilization.Drawing on extensive experience with product, architecture, and code reviews, we have identified examples of TC across different application domains.Platform abstraction layer.  This strategy creates abstraction layers around third-party products and libraries, protecting application code from external API changes. When these products need replacing, adjustments are made only to the abstraction layer, not the application code. This approach exemplifies TC in reducing the
