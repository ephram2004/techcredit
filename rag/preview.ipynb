      "1. Iterator: The code demonstrates an iterator-like approach in the `ListADTImpl` and `ImmutableListADTImpl` classes. These classes provide methods to traverse and access elements sequentially, such as `get(int index)` and `map()` methods, which align with the Iterator pattern's principle of accessing elements without exposing the underlying representation.\n",

      "3. Adapter Pattern: While not explicitly implemented, the code shows characteristics of an adapter-like approach. The `ImmutableListADTImpl` acts as an adapter between mutable and immutable list representations, providing methods like `getMutableList()` that convert between different list types.\n",
