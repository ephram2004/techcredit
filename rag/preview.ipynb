However, we should also be able to detect when any of the m failing services become\\n * operational again, so that we can use it\\n *\\n * <p>In this example, the circuit breaker pattern is demonstrated by using three services: {@link\\n * DelayedRemoteService}, {@link QuickRemoteService} and {@link MonitoringService}. The monitoring\\n * service is responsible for calling three services: a local service, a quick remove service {@link\\n * QuickRemoteService} and a delayed remote service {@link DelayedRemoteService} , and by using the\\n * circuit breaker construction we ensure that if the call to remote service is going to fail, we\\n * are going to save our resources and not make the function call at all, by wrapping our call to\\n * the remote services in the {@link DefaultCircuitBreaker} implementation object.\\n *\\n * <p>This works as follows: The {@link DefaultCircuitBreaker} object can be in one of three states:\\n * <b>Open</b>, <b>Closed</b> and <b>Half-Open</b>, which represents the real world circuits. If the\\n * state is closed (initial), we assume everything is alright and perform the function call.\\n * However, every time the call fails, we note it and once it crosses a threshold, we set the state\\n * to Open, preventing any further calls to the remote server. Then, after a certain retry period\\n * (during which we expect thee service to recover), we make another call to the remote server and\\n * this state is called the Half-Open state, where it stays till the service is down, and once it\\n * recovers, it goes back to the closed state and the cycle continues.\\n */\\n@Slf4j\\npublic class App {\\n\\n  /**\\n   * Program entry point.\\n   *\\n   * @param args command line args\\n   */\\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\\n\\n    var serverStartTime = System.nanoTime();\\n\\n    var delayedService = new DelayedRemoteService(serverStartTime, 5);\\n    var delayedServiceCircuitBreaker =\\n        new DefaultCircuitBreaker(delayedService, 3000, 2, 2000 * 1000 * 1000);\\n\\n    var quickService = new QuickRemoteService();\\n    var quickServiceCircuitBreaker =\\n        new DefaultCircuitBreaker(quickService, 3000, 2, 2000 * 1000 * 1000);\\n\\n    // Create an object of monitoring service which makes both local and remote calls\\n    var monitoringService =\\n        new MonitoringService(delayedServiceCircuitBreaker, quickServiceCircuitBreaker);\\n\\n    // Fetch response from local resource\\n    LOGGER.info(monitoringService.localResourceResponse());\\n\\n    // Fetch response from delayed service 2 times, to meet the failure threshold\\n    LOGGER.info(monitoringService.delayedServiceResponse());\\n    LOGGER.info(monitoringService.delayedServiceResponse());\\n\\n    // Fetch current state of delayed service circuit breaker after crossing failure threshold limit\\n    // which is OPEN now\\n    LOGGER.info(delayedServiceCircuitBreaker.getState());\\n\\n    // Meanwhile, the delayed service is down, fetch response from the healthy quick service\\n    LOGGER.info(monitoringService.quickServiceResponse());\\n    LOGGER.info(quickServiceCircuitBreaker.getState());\\n\\n    // Wait for the delayed service to become responsive\\n    try {\\n      LOGGER.info(\"Waiting for delayed service to become responsive\");\\n      Thread.sleep(5000);\\n    } catch (InterruptedException e) {\\n      LOGGER.error(\"An error occurred: \", e);\\n    }\\n    // Check the state of delayed circuit breaker, should be HALF_OPEN\\n    LOGGER.info(delayedServiceCircuitBreaker.getState());\\n\\n    // Fetch response from delayed service, which should be healthy by now\\n    LOGGER.info(monitoringService.delayedServiceResponse());\\n    // As successful response is fetched, it should be CLOSED again.\\n    LOGGER.info(delayedServiceCircuitBreaker.getState());\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n\\nQuestion: Tell me what tech credits does the repo possibly use?\\nAnswer:\\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\n",

This approach exemplifies TC in reducing the\\n\\nThe following are snippets of codes that are most similar to example codes of \\ntech credits.\\n\\nHere is the No. 1 part of a tech credit\\nDescirption:\\nIterator: Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.\\n\\nExample code for that tech credit:\\n// TC_TYPE: iterator \\n\\npackage Iterator;\\n\\n/**\\n * Represents a book with a title and an author.\\n */\\npublic class Book {\\n    private String title;\\n    private String author;\\n\\n    public Book(String title, String author) {\\n        this.title = title;\\n        this.author = author;\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public String toString() {\\n        return title + \" by \" + author;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// TC_TYPE: iterator \\n\\npackage Iterator;\\n\\n/**\\n * Represents a book with a title and an author.\\n */\\npublic class Book {\\n    private String title;\\n    private String author;\\n\\n    public Book(String title, String author) {\\n        this.title = title;\\n        this.author = author;\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public String toString() {\\n        return title + \" by \" + author;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// TC_TYPE: iterator \\n\\npackage Iterator;\\n\\n/**\\n * Represents a book with a title and an author.\\n */\\npublic class Book {\\n    private String title;\\n    private String author;\\n\\n    public Book(String title, String author) {\\n        this.title = title;\\n        this.author = author;\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public String toString() {\\n        return title + \" by \" + author;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// TC_TYPE: iterator \\n\\npackage Iterator;\\n\\n/**\\n * Represents a book with a title and an author.\\n */\\npublic class Book {\\n    private String title;\\n    private String author;\\n\\n    public Book(String title, String author) {\\n        this.title = title;\\n        this.author = author;\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public String toString() {\\n        return title + \" by \" + author;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nHere is the code from user:\\npackage refactoring_guru.builder.example.cars;\\n\\nimport refactoring_guru.builder.example.components.Engine;\\nimport refactoring_guru.builder.example.components.GPSNavigator;\\nimport refactoring_guru.builder.example.components.Transmission;\\nimport refactoring_guru.builder.example.components.TripComputer;\\n\\n/**\\n * EN: Car manual is another product.

This approach exemplifies TC in reducing the\\n\\nThe following are snippets of codes that are most similar to example codes of \\ntech credits.\\n\\nHere is the No. 1 part of a tech credit\\nDescirption:\\n\\n\\nExample code for that tech credit:\\n* of these things and then, depending on the result, pass the execution to\\n     * the same method in a linked RealSubject object.\\n     */\\n    @Override\\n    public void request() {\\n\\n* the same method in a linked RealSubject object.\\n     */\\n    @Override\\n    public void request() {\\n        if (checkAccess()) {\\n            realSubject.request();\\n            logAccess();\\n\\n*/\\n    @Override\\n    public void request() {\\n        if (checkAccess()) {\\n            realSubject.request();\\n            logAccess();\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n// The method that \"wraps\" protected logic\\n    public <T> T call(Callable<T> task) throws Exception {\\n        // If open, check whether timeout has passed\\n        if (state == State.OPEN) {\\n\\nHere is the code from user:\\npackage refactoring_guru.template_method.example.networks;\\n\\n/**\\n * EN: Class of social network\\n *\\n * RU: Класс социальной сети.\\n */\\npublic class Facebook extends Network {\\n    public Facebook(String userName, String password) {\\n        this.userName = userName;\\n        this.password = password;\\n    }\\n\\n    public boolean logIn(String userName, String password) {\\n        System.out.println(\"\\\\nChecking user\\'s parameters\");\\n        System.out.println(\"Name: \" + this.userName);\\n        System.out.print(\"Password: \");\\n        for (int i = 0; i < this.password.length(); i++) {\\n            System.out.print(\"*\");\\n        }\\n        simulateNetworkLatency();\\n        System.out.println(\"\\\\n\\\\nLogIn success on Facebook\");\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n\\n    public boolean sendData(byte[] data) {\\n        boolean messagePosted = true;\\n        if (messagePosted) {\\n            System.out.println(\"Message: \\'\" + new String(data) + \"\\' was posted on Facebook\");\\n            return true;\\n        } else {\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public void logOut() {\\n        System.out.println(\"User: \\'\" + userName + \"\\' was logged out from Facebook\");\\n    }\\n\\n    private void simulateNetworkLatency() {\\n        try {\\n            int i = 0;\\n            System.out.println();\\n            while (i < 10) {\\n                System.out.print(\".\");\\n                Thread.sleep(500);\\n                i++;\\n            }\\n        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {\\n            ex.printStackTrace();\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nHere is the No. 2 part of a tech credit\\nDescirption:\\n\\n\\nExample code for that tech credit:\\n/**\\n * ConcreteClass2 implements all abstract methods and overrides one of the\\n * hooks.\\n */\\n\\n* the same method in a linked RealSubject object.\\n     */\\n    @Override\\n    public void request() {\\n        if (checkAccess()) {\\n            realSubject.request();\\n            logAccess();\\n\\n/**\\n     * Abstract method that subclasses must implement to define their required\\n     * operation 2.\\n     */\\n    public abstract void requiredOperation2();\\n\\n/**\\n * ConcreteClass1 implements all abstract methods and uses the base operations\\n * with no changes.\\n */\\n\\nHere is the code from user:\\npackage refactoring_guru.template_method.example.networks;\\n\\n/**\\n * EN: Base class of social network.\\n *\\n * RU: Базовый класс социальной сети.\\n */\\npublic abstract class Network {\\n    String userName;\\n    String password;\\n\\n    Network() {}\\n\\n    /**\\n     * EN: Publish the data to whatever network.\\n     *\\n     * RU: Публикация данных в любой сети.\\n     */\\n    public boolean post(String message) {\\n        // EN: Authenticate before posting.
