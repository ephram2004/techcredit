Decorator Pattern:\n- The `SimplePillCounterDecorator` class serves as a base decorator that implements the `PillCounter` interface\n- `PillCounterMonitor` and `BatchAddPillCounter` are concrete decorators that extend `SimplePillCounterDecorator`\n- Each decorator adds new functionality while maintaining the core interface\n- The pattern allows for dynamic addition of responsibilities to objects\n\nThe code follows the classic Decorator Pattern structure where:\n- There's a component interface (`PillCounter`)\n- A base decorator (`SimplePillCounterDecorator`)\n- Concrete decorators (`PillCounterMonitor`, `BatchAddPillCounter`) that add specific behaviors\n\nWhile the code might be part of a larger system that implements other patterns, from the provided snippets, the Decorator Pattern is the only technical credit that can be definitively identified.",
    "alex-lab10": "Based on the provided code snippets and comparing them with the technical credit categories, I can identify the following technical credit:\n\nIterator - The code implements a list data structure with sequential access patterns through interfaces (ListADT, MutableListADT, ImmutableListADT) and their implementation (ListADTImpl). While it doesn't explicitly implement Java's Iterator interface, it provides similar functionality for traversing elements sequentially with methods like get(index), addFront(), addBack(), etc.\n\nThe code also shows characteristics of the Strategy Pattern in how it handles mutable vs immutable list variations, but since Strategy Pattern isn't in the provided technical credit categories list, I'll stick to just identifying Iterator as the main technical credit present.",

The test class `AdapterPatternTest` that verifies the adapter functionality\n3. The `App` class that explicitly documents and demonstrates the Adapter pattern usage\n\nThe code shows a classic implementation of the Adapter pattern where it converts the interface of a FishingBoat (adaptee) into a RowingBoat interface (target) that the Captain (client) expects.\n\nFrom the provided technical credit categories list, the only pattern that is clearly evident in these code snippets is:\n- Adapter Pattern",
    "iluwatar-builder": "Based on the provided code and comparing it with the example tech credit patterns, this repository clearly implements the Builder Pattern. Here's why:\n\n1. Builder Pattern:\n- The code explicitly implements the Builder pattern through the `Hero.Builder` class\n- It follows the classic Builder pattern structure with:\n  - A private constructor in the main class (Hero)\n  - A static Builder class\n  - Fluent interface with \"with\" methods returning the builder\n  - A final build() method\n- The pattern is used to solve the telescoping constructor problem, as mentioned in the comments\n- The implementation is very similar to the example Builder pattern code shown in the Computer example\n\nThe code's comments even explicitly state that this is an implementation of the Builder pattern as described by Joshua Bloch in Effective Java 2nd Edition.\n\nWhile the code is in a package that includes \"model-view-viewmodel\" in its license header, there isn't enough evidence in the provided code snippets to definitively claim it implements MVC or any other design patterns from the technical credit categories list.\n\nTherefore, from the given technical credit categories and based on the code provided, the only clear technical credit present is:\n- Builder Pattern",

The Request class is used to encapsulate request information\n3. The OrcKing class acts as the client that initiates requests through the chain\n4. The pattern is explicitly mentioned in the code comments: \"The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a design pattern consisting of command objects and a series of processing objects\"\n5. The implementation follows the same structure as the example code, with handlers being able to process requests or pass them along the chain\n\nThe code structure and implementation closely matches the Chain of responsibility pattern example, where requests are passed through a chain of handlers until one can process it.",

The package name explicitly includes \"decorator\"\n2. There's a `Troll` interface that defines the core behavior\n3. The `App` class documentation explicitly states \"The Decorator pattern is a more flexible alternative to subclassing\"\n4. The code demonstrates the pattern by decorating a `SimpleTroll` with a `ClubbedTroll` to modify its behavior at runtime\n5.

The typical MVC structure where:\n- The Controller (GiantController) has references to both Model and View\n- The Controller updates the Model and triggers View updates\n- The Model holds the business data (health, fatigue, nourishment)\n- The View is responsible for displaying the giant's status\n\n3.
