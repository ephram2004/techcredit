Figure 2.  Conceptual model of technical credit.1 Technical Credit in PracticeDecisions leading to TC are inherently connected to a system’s business domain and product roadmap. However, not all design decisions yield true TC: those not enabling cost-effective modifications in line with business objectives might be deemed over-engineering. We create TC by crafting design decisions that ease future modifications anticipated by the product’s roadmap. Thus, a design decision yields technical credit

Example code for that tech credit:
public BookIterator(List<Book> books) {
        this.books = books;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return index < books.size();
    }

public void showTasks(List<String> tasks) {
        System.out.println("Current Tasks:");
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.size(); i++) {

@Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return index < books.size();

Circuit breakers are TC as they guard against cascading failures caused by slow responses to requests that lead to congestion, overload and eventual failure in calling services. They ensure system resilience and facilitate its evolution.Reference architectures (RAs).\xa0 RAs capture the essence of the architecture of a collection of systems in a given domain, serving prescriptive, descriptive, and informative roles. They guide the development, standardization, and evolution of architectures within an application domain and aid decision-making by disseminating architectural knowledge. As such, RAs are a form of technical credit.A Research Agenda for Technical CreditWe believe TC warrants comprehensive investigation and scrutiny from the software engineering community. Analogous to technical debt, we see three broad areas of research to explore1: defining, comprehending, and\n\nThe following are snippets of codes that are most similar to example codes of \ntech credits.\n\nHere is the No. 1 part of a tech credit\nDescirption:\n\n\nExample code for that tech credit:\npublic BookIterator(List<Book> books) {\n        this.books = books;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        return index < books.size();\n    }\n\npublic void showTasks(List<String> tasks) {\n        System.out.println("Current Tasks:");\n        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.size(); i++) {\n\n@Override\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        return index < books.size();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Book next() {\n        return books.get(index++);\n    }\n}\n\npublic void addTask(String task) {\n        tasks.add(task);\n    }\n\n    public List<String> getTasks() {\n        return tasks;\n    }\n}\n\nHere is the code from user:\njects currently in this list.\n   *\n   * @return the size of the list\n   */\n  int getSize();\n\n  /**\n   * Get the (index)th object in this list.\n   *\n   * @param index the index of the ob\n\nHere is the No. 2 part of a tech credit\nDescirption:\n\n\nExample code for that tech credit:\nimport java.util.List;\n\n// TC_TYPE: iterator \n\npackage Iterator;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Iterator;\nimport java.util.List;\n\n/**\n * Aggregate class that holds a collection of books\n */\n\n// TC_TYPE: model_view_controller\n\npackage MVC;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\n/**\n * Model class that manages the list of tasks\n */\n\n* \n     * @param args Command-line arguments (not used).\n     */\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a list of components\n\nHere is the code from user:\nadt.CommonListADT;\nimport listadt.ImmutableListADT;\nimport listadt.ImmutableListADTImpl;\nimport listadt.MutableListADT;\nimport listadt.MutableListADTImpl;\nimport org.\n\nHere is the No. 3 part of a tech credit\nDescirption:\n\n\nExample code for that tech credit:\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic void addTask(String task) {\n        tasks.add(task);\n    }\n\n    public List<String> getTasks() {\n        return tasks;\n    }\n}\n\n* \n     * @param data The data to be processed by the algorithm.\n     * @return The result of the algorithm.\n     */\n    List<String> doAlgorithm(List<String> data);\n}\n\n// TC_TYPE: model_view_controller\n\npackage MVC;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\n/**\n * Model class that manages the list of tasks\n */\n\nHere is the code from user:\njava.util.function.Function;\nimport listadt.CommonListADT;\nimport listadt.ImmutableListADT;\nimport listadt.ImmutableListADTImpl;\nimport listadt.MutableListADT;\nimport listadt.Mut\n\n\nQuestion: Tell me what tech credits does the repo possibly use?\nAnswer:\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]
